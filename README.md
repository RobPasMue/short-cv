Project containing my one-page resume in LaTeX.

## Further details

The project consists on a main `tex` file named `ROBERTO-PASTOR.tex` which makes use of a template
class `twentysecondcv.cls`.

This project also contains a Makefile for automating the build of the resume, and a GitHub workflow
for automating its build, upload as an artifact and official release (when tags are used).
